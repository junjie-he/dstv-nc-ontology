# DSTV:Steel Construction Ontology

## Overview 

DSTV:Steel Construction Ontology is sub-domain ontology linked to the top-level process ontology Internet of Construction Process Ontology(ioc).


## Developing

The extended DSTV:Steel Construction Ontology is capable of linking heterogenous data for:
1. Visualizing features described in DSTV-NC interface
2. Validating deviations against DIN norm tolerances
3. Adjusting plan values to compensate deviations
4. Realizing semantic interoperability between entities in steel construction domain


### 1. Visualization

**GhPython script for querying the ontology with SPARQL and visualize the DSTV geometries in Rhino7.**

**Note**
1. Replace the SPARQL script path with your own absolute path to external script.
2. Run the GhPython script to call the external script.
